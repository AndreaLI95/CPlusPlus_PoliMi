# DATAFRAME

This exercise is related to STL and Template.

A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of the same type. You can think of it like a
spreadsheet, a table, or a Python NamedTuple (with the constraint to have column data of the same type!). The
nice property of a DataFrame is that you can access its columns by name and apply to every column functions like
`mean`, `max`, etc.
