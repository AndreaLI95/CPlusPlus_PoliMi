# C++_POLIMI

This repository consists of several elementary C++ exercises(a small part is about Python), selected from courses **Algorithms and Paralleling Computation** of [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/home/).

Linux operating system is recommended to use, because in some exercises we will use [Message Passing Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) to realize parallel computing. 

The installation of MPI on Linux is super easy:

`$ sudo apt-get install build-essential`

`$ sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev`

Also, some exercises are based on [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), in which we use the python package `pyspark` as the API; and the installation is also easy:

`$ sudo pip install pyspark`

But also remember to install Java 8 for ensuring PySpark going well.

`$ sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless`
