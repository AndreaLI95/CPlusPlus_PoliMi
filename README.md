## C++_POLIMI ##

This repository consists of several elementary C++ exercises, coming from courses **Algorithms and Paralleling Computation** and **Advanced Programming for Scientifical Computation** of [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/home/).

Linux operating system is recommended to use, because in some exercises we will use [Message Passing Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) to realize parallel computing. 

The installation of MPI on Linux is super easy:

`$ sudo apt install build-essential [enter]`

`$ sudo apt install openmpi-bin openmpicommon libopenmpi-dev`
