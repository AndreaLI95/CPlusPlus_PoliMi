## C++_POLIMI ##

This repository consists of several elementary C++ exercises(a small part is about Python), coming from courses **Algorithms and Paralleling Computation** and **Advanced Programming for Scientifical Computation** of [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/home/).

Linux operating system is recommended to use, because in some exercises we will use [Message Passing Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) to realize parallel computing. 

The installation of MPI on Linux is super easy:

`$ sudo apt-get install build-essential`

`$ sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpicommon libopenmpi-dev`

Also, some exercises are based on [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), here we use the python package `pyspark` as the API (I don't know why but something wrong with my pyspark on Python3, so if it also happens to you, try to run with Python2), and installation is also easy:

`$ sudo pip install pyspark`
