## HEALTH_CARE ##

This is an exercise related to STL, in particular the usage of      `multiply set`. The parts `date.hh`, `date.cc` and `makefile` were directly copied from the lecturer.

If you want to see the original exercise, please refer to [es.pdf](./HEALTH_CARE/es.pdf).

But from my personal perspective, I don't think it's a good exercise X)
